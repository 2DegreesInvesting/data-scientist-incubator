# renv

```R
renv::init()

Welcome to renv! It looks like this is your first time using renv.
This is a one-time message, briefly describing some of renv's functionality.

This package maintains a local cache of data on the filesystem at:

  - '~/.local/share/renv'

This path can be customized -- see the documentation in `?paths`.

renv will also write to files within the active project folder, including:

  - A folder 'renv' in the project directory, and
  - A lockfile called 'renv.lock' in the project directory.

In particular, projects using renv will normally use a private, per-project
R library, in which new packages will be installed. This project library is
isolated from other R libraries on your system.

In addition, renv will attempt to update files within your project, including:

  - .gitignore
  - .Rbuildignore
  - .Rprofile

Please read the introduction vignette with `vignette("renv")` for more information.
You can also browse the package documentation online at http://rstudio.github.io/renv.

By providing consent, you will allow renv to write and update these files.

Restarting R session...

* Project '~/git/todo' loaded. [renv 0.9.3]
```

If I now use a package new to this project, this happens:

* RStudio tells me the package isn't installed, and prompt me to install it -- even if the package is installed in the system).

* renv records the new package
