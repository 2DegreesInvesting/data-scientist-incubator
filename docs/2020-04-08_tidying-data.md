_Comparing gather to pivot_longer and spread to pivot_wider_ ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/33))

You may like this content if you use [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) to analyze tidy data (as defined [here](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) and [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)). This includes 2DII folks and beyond.

> Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.
