You learn about three tools you can combine to improve the way you manage data: Azure, RStudio server and the pins package. As a side effect you will also learn a system we plan to use in a longer workshop. Find materials are at https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/45; the most important document to follow along is https://bit.ly/dsi-pin-azure. 29.1 Introduction Open 00_intro-rmd.Rmd The goal of this section is to practice the tools we’ll be using later: A collaborative document. Zoom. RMarkdown documents. Managing these three things at once is hard and will likely distract you from learning anything. A little practice will help you will master these tools so you can focus on the content of the lessons to come. 29.1.1 Objective Run a code chunk. Click “yes” on the “Participants” tab on Zoom. Write “hi” in the \"Questions section for this lesson on https://bit.ly/dsi-pin-azure. This is just to ensure you know where we expect you to ask questions. 29.1.2 RMarkdown notebooks This is an R Markdown Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. R code goes in code chunks, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this chunk by clicking the Run button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing Crtl+Shift+Enter (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Enter (Mac). packageVersion(&quot;pins&quot;) 29.2 Setup an Azure board for pins Open 01_setup-azure-board.Rmd 29.2.1 Objective Setup an Azure board for pins. 29.2.2 Setup an Azure board for pins Open your .Renviron file with usethis::edit_r_environ(). Add this: AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=&quot;test-container&quot; AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=&quot;2diiteststorage&quot; # Not my real key AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=&quot;ABABAB...==&quot; Replace “ABABAB…==” with the value I’ll share privately. Ensure the file ends with a new line. Save, close, and restart R. Set these variables in you .Renviron. See ?usethis::edit_r_environ(). 29.3 Use an Azure board Open 02_use-azure-board.Rmd https://bit.ly/dsi-pin-azure 29.3.1 Objectives Use the pins package and register our Azure board Find datasets in our Azure board Get a dataset from our Azure board Save processed data to the server’s cache Visualize the structure of the server’s cache. 29.3.2 Use the pins package and register our Azure board Use the pins package with library(pins). Register our Azure board with board_register_azure() library(pins) board_register_azure() 29.3.3 Find datasets in our Azure board Find pins on our Azure board from the Connections tab. Find pins on our Azure board with the Addin “Find pins”. Find pins on our Azure board with pin_find(), by name or description. pin_find(&quot;mtc&quot;, board = &quot;azure&quot;) 29.3.4 Get a dataset from our Azure board Get the mtcars dataset from our Azure board with pin_get(). Assign the result to the object mydata. Inspect mydata however you like. How many rows does it have? mydata &lt;- pin_get(&quot;mtcars&quot;, board = &quot;azure&quot;) mydata 29.3.5 Save processed data to the server’s cache Get the head() of mydata and assign it to a new object smalldata. smalldata &lt;- head(mydata) smalldata Store smalldata in you local (server) cache with pin() pin(smalldata) Find “smalldata” in your local (server) cache, however you like. pin_find(&quot;smalldata&quot;) Get “smalldata” from your local (server) cache. pin_get(&quot;smalldata&quot;) 29.3.6 Visualize the structure of the server’s cache. Create a path to the local (server) cache that pins created for you. server_cache &lt;- board_cache_path() server_cache Explore the structure of the local (server) cache with fs::dir_tree(). fs::dir_tree(server_cache) 29.3.7 Takeaways Go to the collaborative document and write your takeaways. &lt;bit.ly/dsi-pin-azure&gt; "]
