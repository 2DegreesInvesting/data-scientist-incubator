This meetup is for you if you use dplyr or want an overview of refactoring.

[dplyr 1.0.0 is comming soon]( https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/dplyr-1-0-0-is-coming-soon/). I includes great new features but also many [changes that can break your code](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/master/NEWS.md#breaking-changes). You will likely need to change your code, and you can save time and pain of you know about Refactoring.

## Content

* Where to find [dplyr's breaking changes](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/master/NEWS.md#breaking-changes) and [new features](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/)

* How to isolate your projects with [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).
    * DEMO

> If the potential for changes makes you nervous, now is a good time to learn about [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). renv allows to create isolated, reproducible, projects so that you can experiment with new package versions while feeling secure that your existing projects will continue to work as they always have. -- <https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/dplyr-1-0-0-is-coming-soon/>

* Refactoring

    * [What is it?](https://refactoring.com/) _"Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior"._
    *  Rename variable
        * [Catalog](https://refactoring.com/catalog/)

* Why is it useful to have tests. 

* Why is it useful to use Git.
