# Introduction {-}

This book contains materials presented at meetups of the ds-incubator.


The goal of the ds-incubator (data science incubator) is to share best practices in coding. It helps us to become better data scientists and to improve out work at  at [2° Investing Initiative](http://2degrees-investing.org/).

This project is managed by [Mauro](https://github.com/maurolepore) with support from [CJ](https://github.com/orgs/2DegreesInvesting/people/cjyetman) and guidance from [Klaus](https://github.com/orgs/2DegreesInvesting/people/2diiKlaus) and [Clare](https://github.com/orgs/2DegreesInvesting/people/Clare2D). Since mid-October, 2019 we meet online weekly. We welcome contributions from everyone at [2° Investing Initiative](http://2degrees-investing.org/).
