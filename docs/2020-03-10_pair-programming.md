## Strong-Style Pairing

The rule: 

> For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else's hands. 

Particularly useful for knowledge transfer



## Discuss: Benefits (5')

* Knowledge Sharing
* Reflection
* Keeping focus
* Code review on-the-go
* Two modes of thinking combined
* Collective Code Ownership
* Keeps the team's WIP low
* Fast onboarding of new team members



## Discuss: Challenges (5')

* Pairing can be exhausting
* Intense collaboration can be hard
* Interruptions by meetings
* Different skill levels
* Power Dynamics
* Pairing with lots of Unknowns
* No time for yourself
* Rotations lead to context switching
* Pairing requires vulnerability
* Convincing managers and co-workers



## To pair or not to pair

* Boring Tasks 
* Need space to figure things out



## Problems with code review vs. pairing

* not looking too closely at the code. 
* avoid rework for something that we invested in.
* disruptive to switch context 



## Why bother?

It takes:

* Concentration and focus (suitable style), 
* task organization (find problem, solution, and plan), 
* time management (e.g. pomodoro), 
* communication, 
* giving and receiving feedback, 
* empathy, 
* vulnerability 

Work on getting better at it, you will end up with a more resilient team.
