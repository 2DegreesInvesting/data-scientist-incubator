## To pair or not to pair

* Boring Tasks 
* Need space to figure things out



## Problems with code review vs. pairing

* not looking too closely at the code. 
* avoid rework for something that we invested in.
* disruptive to switch context 



## Why bother?

It takes:

* Concentration and focus (suitable style), 
* task organization (find problem, solution, and plan), 
* time management (e.g. pomodoro), 
* communication, 
* giving and receiving feedback, 
* empathy, 
* vulnerability 

Work on getting better at it, you will end up with a more resilient team.
