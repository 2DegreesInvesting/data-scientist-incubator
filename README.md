# ds-incubator

The goal of the data science incubator (ds-incubator) is to share best practices
in data-science. The main element of the project is an internal, online meetup,
every Tuesdays at 16:00 GMT+2 (Berlin). A number of meetups (typically 3-6) make
up a series, focused on a topic that is interesting to us and useful to broader
open source community. We vote which topic to cover based on a few
[suggestions](https://bit.ly/dsi-ideas) and and contributed ideas.

Each series has:

1. A GitHub issue that briefly describes the
series and guides the logistics of each meetup
([example](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/75)).

2. A GitHub repository with a syllabus
([example](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.reprex)).

Each meetup has:

* A folder in the series repo with the materials covered in that meetup
([example](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.reprex/tree/master/01_overview)).

* A recording posted on the [ds-incubator
YouTube-playlist](https://bit.ly/ds-incubator-videos), including a link to the
meetup section on the series syllabus.

* A post sharing the meetup recording with `#rstats` on twitter
([example](https://twitter.com/mauro_lepore/status/1425121104784416769?s=20)).
