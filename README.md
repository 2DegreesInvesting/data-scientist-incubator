_data scientists' incubator_

> As a data-scientist who wants to work in a more transparent, reproducible, and collaborative way, I would like to learn and share the best practices in data science.

The goal of this project is to provide a system and resources to help you become a better data scientist. The system is inspired in research on how we learn, and on the success of the Carpentries and rOpenSci in building community and in onboarding data scientists.

To share best practices in data science, we plan a meetup in Berlin, in early 2020. Here we can discuss, plan, and develop the materials.
