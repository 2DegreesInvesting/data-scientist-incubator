## Your turn

Reproduce the code in [R packages, Chapter 2: The whole game](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html).

You may use the [foofactors project on rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/47358/project/897065). The branch `master` is an empty package. To see the end product, you may checkout the branch `jenny` with `git checkout jenny`. 

...

## Your turn

You may also explore the history of Jenny's commits. Each commit is tagged with numbers 1-14. To see what the package looked like at, say, Jenny's 4th commit, run `git checkout 4`.
