## Your turn

Using our [rstudio.cloud project](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/47358/project/897065), checkout each commit by Jenny Bryan and map it to what she writes on [R packages, Chapter 2: The whole game](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html). Each commit is tagged with numbers 1-14. For example, you can checkout Jenny's 4th commit with `git checkout 4`, see what the package looks like at that stage, then return to the master branch with `git checkout master`.
