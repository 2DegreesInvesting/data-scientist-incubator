```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  error = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE
)
```

We start by using required packages.

```{r}
library(r2dii.dataraw)
library(r2dii.match)
```

* [`prioritize()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/reference/prioritize.html) helps you to prioritize matching results (see [`?match_name()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/reference/match_name.html)).

```{r}
matched <- match_name(loanbook_demo, ald_demo)
prioritize(matched)
```
