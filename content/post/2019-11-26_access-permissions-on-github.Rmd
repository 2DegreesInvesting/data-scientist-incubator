# Access permissions for a GitHub organization

https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/issues/14

## Situation

You want to propose changes to a source repo on a GitHub organization.

* Set the usual plumbing (`create_from_github()`).

* Initiate and work on your pull request (PR) (`pr_init()`).

* Synchronize, push, and submit your PR (`pr_sync()`, `pr_push()`).

## Set the usual plumbing

* Fork source repo to your user account.

* Create a local clone of your fork.

* Connect your local clone with your fork (add remote origin).

* Connect your local clone with the source repo (add remote upstream).

## Initiate and work on your PR

* Create a local branch to host PR.

* Change the local clone.

* Commit informing what changed and why.

## Synchronize, push, and submit your PR

* Synchronize the source repository to get the latest changes.

* Push your PR to your fork.

* Submit your PR from your fork to the source repo.

## But something goes wrong

The set up involves too many steps.

Unless you do it systematically (e.g. with usethis) sooner or later you will forget some step. 

For example, these are my most common mistakes:

* I copy the wrong URL so remote origin points to the source repo instead of my fork.

* I forget to create a new branch and add commits to my local `master` branch.

## What happens when you push?

1. Your commit(s) are now in the PR branch of your fork.
1. Your commit(s) are now in the master branch of your fork.
1. Your commit(s) are now in the PR branch  of the source repo.
1. Your commit(s) are now in the master branch of the source repo.
1. You fail to push and get an error.
1. It depends on your role and permission level:
    
    * Roles: Owner, ..., member, collaborator.
    * Permission levels: Admin, ..., push (write), read.

## [Owner, billing manager & member](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github)

__Organization members can have owner, billing manager, or member roles.__

__Owners__ have complete administrative access to your organization, while __billing managers__ can manage billing settings. __Member__ is the default role for everyone else. 

## Members, teams & outside collaborators

* You can set the default of what __members__ can do for all repos.
* You can manage access permissions for multiple members at a time with __teams__.
* You can invite __outside collaborators__ to give them access to __specific repositories__.

## Permission levels for repositories

* __Read__: Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project.

* __Triage__: Recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and PRs without write access.

* __Write__: Recommended for contributors who actively push to your project.

* __Maintain__: Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions.

...

## Permission levels for repositories (continued)

...

* __Admin__: Recommended for people who need full access to the project, __including sensitive and destructive actions__ like managing security or deleting a repository.

__Organization owners have admin permissions for every repository owned by the organization__ ([table](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#repository-access-for-each-permission-level)).
