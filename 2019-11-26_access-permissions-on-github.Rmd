## [Permission levels for an organization](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github)

__Organization members can have owner, billing manager, or member roles.__

__Owners__ have complete administrative access to your organization, while __billing managers__ can manage billing settings. __Member__ is the default role for everyone else. 

Members, teams & outside collaborators:

* You can set the default of what any organization members can do for all repos.
* You can manage access permissions for multiple members at a time with __teams__.
* You can invite outside collaborators to give them access to specific repositories.

## Permission levels for repositories

* __Read__: Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project
* __Triage__: Recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access
* __Write__: Recommended for contributors who actively push to your project
* __Maintain__: Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions
* __Admin__: Recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository

__Organization owners have admin permissions for every repository owned by the organization.__

## Situations

You fork a repo, add a commit and push accidentally push it to upstream/master. What happens if?

* As an individual you have read only access to the repo.
* All members are set to have admin/read privileges.
* You are an owner/member/collaborator.

## How this relates to the GitHub workflow?

It depends on the workflow: GitHub workflow

## Conclusion

* Give Owner permissions to a small group of people.
* Don't give people more access to the project than they need.
