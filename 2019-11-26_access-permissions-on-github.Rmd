## [Access permissions for a GitHub organization](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github)

# Situation

* You want to propose changes to a source repo on a GitHub organization.
* The organization uses the GitHub workflow.

## Set the usual plumbing

* Fork the source repo to your user account on GitHub.
* Create a local clone of your fork.
* Connect your local clone with your fork (i.e. add remote origin).
* Connect your local clone with the source repo (i.e. add remote upstream).

_Which function from the usethis package could you use?_

## Initiate and work on your PR

* Create a local branch to host your pull request (PR).
* Change something in your local clone.
* Create a commit with a message of what changed and why.

_Which function from the usethis package could you use?_

## Synchronize, push, and submit your PR

* Synchronize the source repository to get the latest changes.
* Push your commit to your fork.
* Submit a pull request.

_Which functions from the usethis package could you use?_

## But you are feeling adventurous

You did all of that by hand and some things went wrong:

1. You copied the wrong URL so remote origin now points to the source repo -- not your fork.
2. You forgot to create a new branch and commited to your local `master` branch.

## What happens when you push?

1. Your commit(s) are now in the PR branch of your fork.
1. Your commit(s) are now in the master branch of your fork.
1. Your commit(s) are now in the PR branch  of the source repo.
1. Your commit(s) are now in the master branch of the source repo.
1. You fail to push and get an error.
1. It depends on your role and permission level:
    
    * Roles: Owner, ..., member, collaborator.
    * Permission levels: Admin, ..., push (write), read.

## [Owner, billing manager & member](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github)

__Organization members can have owner, billing manager, or member roles.__

__Owners__ have complete administrative access to your organization, while __billing managers__ can manage billing settings. __Member__ is the default role for everyone else. 

## Members, teams & outside collaborators

* You can set the default of what any organization members can do for all repos.
* You can manage access permissions for multiple members at a time with __teams__.
* You can invite outside collaborators to give them access to specific repositories.

## Permission levels for repositories

* __Read__: Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project.

* __Triage__: Recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access.

* __Write__: Recommended for contributors who actively push to your project.

* __Maintain__: Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions.

* __Admin__: Recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository.

## Permission levels for repositories

* __Admin__: Recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository.

__Organization owners have admin permissions for every repository owned by the organization__ ([table](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#repository-access-for-each-permission-level)).

* Don't give people more access to the project than they need.
* Let usethis help you.
