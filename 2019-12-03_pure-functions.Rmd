## Pure function

A function that has the following properties:

1. The function always returns the same value for the same inputs.

2. Evaluation of the function has no side effects`**`

`**` Types of side effects:

* Give feedback: e.g. `print()`, `message()`, `plot()`.
* Change global state: e.g. `<-`, `<<-`, `assigne()`. , `library()`, `setwd()`, `write.csv()`

See [Side-effect soup](https://principles.tidyverse.org/side-effect-soup.html#side-effect-soup))

Effectively, a pure functionâ€™s return value is based only on its inputs and has no other dependencies or effects on the overall program.

## Avoid hidden arguments
