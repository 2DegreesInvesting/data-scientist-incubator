## reprex

* [reprex usage](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/index.html#usage)
* [Reprex do’s and don’ts](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html)
* [This seems like a lot of work!](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html#this-seems-like-a-lot-of-work)

# Beyond reprex (.Rmd)


## Why .Rmd?

* reprex can't read data from your system

```r
reprex::reprex(
  readr::read_csv(here::here("your-file.csv"))
)
#> Error: 'your-file.csv' does not exist in current working directory
('C:/Users/Mauro/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpCqzepI/reprex4e7022114c1f').
```

* R Markdown can.

```{r, message=FALSE}
data <- readr::read_csv(here::here("your-file.csv"))
head(data, 2)
```



## Why `here::here()`?

.Rmd files have a weird notion of working directory

`here::here()` is what you normally expect.

```{r}
here::here()
```



## reprex with R Markdown

_File > New File > R Markdown..._

## reprex with R Markdown

* Write your-file.Rmd, e.g.:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(readr)

data <- read_csv(here::here("your-file.csv"))
head(data, 2)

# More code ...
```

* Knit your-file.Rmd (press the _Knit_ button).
* Commit and push; GitHub will render your-file.md beautifully.
* Share your-file.csv and the [link to your-file.md](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds-incubator/blob/master/2019-12-10_reprex.md).



```{r cleaup, echo=FALSE}
on.exit(fs::file_delete("your-file.csv"))
```
